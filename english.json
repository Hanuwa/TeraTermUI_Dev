	"intro_box": "Welcome to the Tera Term UI Application!\n\nThe purpose of this application is to facilitate the process enrolling and dropping classes, since Tera Term uses Terminal interface, it's hard for new users to use and learn how to navigate and do stuff in Tera Term. This application has a very nice and clean user interface that most users are used to.\n\nThere's a few things you should know before using this tool: \n\nThe application is very early in development, which means it still got things to work, fix and implement. Right now, the applications lets you do the essentials like enrolling and dropping classes, searching for classes other functionally will be implemented later down the road the priority right now is getting the user experience right, everything must looks nice and be easy to understand. Everything you input here is stored locally meaning only you can access the information so you will not have to worry about securities issues plus for sensitive information like the Social Security Number, they get encrypted using AES. \n\nThanks for using our application, for more information, help and to customize your experience make sure to click the buttons on the sidebar, the application is also planned to be open source for anyone who is interested in working/seeing the project. \n\nIMPORTANT: DO NOT USE WHILE HAVING ANOTHER INSTANCE OF THE APPLICATION OPENED.",
