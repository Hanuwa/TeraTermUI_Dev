If you run the application as an Administrator, it grants the benefit of disabling user input when the application is automating and performing tasks in Tera Term, good to mitigate the chance of the user interrupting the executions of actions by Tera Term UI.

Note* Installation File includes option to install Tera Term, although it is recommended to setup all of Tera Term's configurations before using this application, please refer to: https://osi.uprb.edu/manuales/Conexion_SSH_TeraTerm_TTSSH_STUDENTS.pdf
