# Tera Term UI Dev
Dev Environment for Tera Term UI (Virtualenv)

**App Version:** "0.9.5" | **Python Version:** "3.12.4" | **Tesseract Version:** "5.4.0" | **C Compiler:** "MSVC"

**Important** modules of "**ctkmessagebox.py, ctk_input_dialog.py, ctk_scrollable_frame.py, ctk_tabview.py, ctk_toplevel.py,
ctk_textbox.py, ctk_scrollbar.py, ctk_checkbox.py, ctk_radiobutton.py, ctk_switch.py, ctk_optionmenu.py, appearance_mode_tracker.py,
dropdown_menu.py, scaling_tracker.py, scaling_base_class.py, ctk_base_class.py, ctk_canvas.py and draw_engine.py**" are included here because they have some modifications.

Priorities of the development of the application is working on improving the UI since it's a bit too simple and not polished,
funtionality wise the application is mostly feature-complete but it could use some performance/optimization improvements since
the application sometimes suffers from slowdows which can make it feel sluggish to use.

# Tesseract OCR
Must install this application under a folder within the TeraTermUI project called "Tesseract-OCR".
This application is for OCR scanning, basically reading text from images, the reason we need this is
because we don't have access to the database of the University and to error proof the application for things like
the Social Security Number we have no way of validating that information so what we do is after the action is performed on Tera Term,
we take a screenshot of the result and perform OCR using Tesseract to see if an error occured within Tera Term. 
Now using this tool we can now stop the execution of code and show error message within our app if the user did something wrong.

# GUI Framework
The whole GUI is made using customtkinter, read wiki to familiarize yourself with it, can work in conjunction with the normal tkinter too.
It is versatile and really good looking but also very incomplete and its performance is lackluster, which is why I have customized and

# Convert from .py to .exe
We convert the application to an executable using Nuitka, which is a library that basically coverts your python code into C then it compiles and bundles your application together
and makes the .py file into an executable **(C compiler required)**, it's a really good tool and it even increases the performance of some tasks. https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka
