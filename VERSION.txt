Release Date: 05/02/2025

Patch Notes:
 - Introduced new feature called "Swap Rows": You can now quickly swap the content between two adjacent rows in the Multiple 
   Classes Enrollment screen. Clicking the â‡… Swap Button next to a class row exchanges its class code, section, semester, and 
   enrollment action with its neighbor
 - Added new image called "arrows" for the swap buttons for clarity
 - Improved implementation of "Auto-Enroll", also better responsiveness and accuracy of countdown window
 - Added awareness to take into account a new class status on enrollment called "RECOMMENDED"
 - Added new error message from enrollment called "PRESENTLY ENROLLED"
 - Fixed an issue that prevented remembering credentials, when you had data previously saved
 - Updated dependencies, one of which is for the .exe covertion tool of the main app and updater for stability

Hotfix*
 - When multiple courses share the same code and semester, they are now enumarated (Ex. ESPA3101 #1 or ESPA3101 #2 - C51)
 - Now before we start to execute any command on the terminal we first send "Ctrl+Q" to resume the shell if it was paused
 - Optimized and improved the performance of the class schedule conflicts functionality
 - Cleanup up some logic inside the updater
 - Updated dependencies
