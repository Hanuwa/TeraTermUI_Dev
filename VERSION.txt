Patch Notes:

   enrollment action with its neighbor
 - Added new image called "arrows" for the swap buttons for clarity
 - Improved implementation of "Auto-Enroll", also better responsiveness and accuracy of countdown window
 - Added awareness to take into account a new class status on enrollment called "RECOMMENDED"
 - Added new error message from enrollment called "PRESENTLY ENROLLED"
 - Updated dependencies, one of which is for the .exe covertion tool of the main app and updater for stability
